# What is the purpose of this repository?
The growing interest of the kinematics community in cuspidal robots have encouraged the authors of this repository to create a place where people can acquaint themselves to the idea of cuspidal robots. The idea of robots changing IKS without crossing singularities may sound simple or confusing or downright flawed at first, but when the topic is investigated in depth, the issues/special properties of cuspidal robots are evident. Are cuspidal robots good or bad? That is an ongoing question in the community. It is similar to asking the question, are singularities in mechanisms good or bad? A person who has just manufactured a mechanism and fails to control the robot as one wished, singularities are bad, but to the person initiated in the intricacies of mechanisms, singularities are a useful tool. 

But, wait...

# What are cuspidal robots?
Glad you asked...

Cuspidal serial robots are those robots who can change their inverse kinematic solutions (IKS) without meeting a singular configuration. This implies that there are multiple IKS in at least one of the singularity free connected regions in the joint space. These regions are also called as aspects.
